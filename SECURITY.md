# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in any of my projects, please report it responsibly.

**Do NOT open a public issue.**

Instead, email me directly at: **hychangee@gmail.com**

I will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and work with you to understand and address the issue.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release of each project is actively maintained. If you find an issue in an older version, please verify it exists in the latest release before reporting.

## Disclosure

I follow coordinated disclosure. I will credit you (if desired) in the fix advisory.
